# Keep Presence (fork)

This program moves the mouse or press a key when it detects that you are away.  
It won't do anything if you are using your computer.  
Useful to trick your machine to think you are still working with it. 

#### Additional functionality introduced by this forked version

Allows keep-presence to be enabled/disabled via the presence of a file located at `~/.keep-presence-disabled`. If this file exists
then keep-presence will not attempt to trick the machine that it's being used.

I am using this additional functionality alongside i3blocks, whereby I have a clickable blocklet that enables/disables keep-presence
by creating/deleting the `~/.keep-presence-disabled` file.

I have also introduced an additional command line argument that controls whether keep-presence is disabled at startup.

## Optional arguments

```
-h, --help                        show this help message and exit
            
-s SECONDS, --seconds SECONDS     Define in seconds how long to wait after a user is
                                  considered idle. Default 300.

-p PIXELS, --pixels PIXELS        Set how many pixels the mouse should move. Default 1.

-c, --circular                    Move mouse in a circle. Default move diagonally.

-m MODE, --mode MODE              Available options: keyboard, mouse, both; default is mouse. 
                                  This is the action that will be executed when the user is idle. 
                                  If keyboard is selected, the program will press the shift key. 
                                  If mouse is selected, the program will move the mouse. 
                                  If both is selected, the program will do both actions.

-r RANDOM RANDOM, --random RANDOM RANDOM
                                  Usage: two numbers (ex. -r 3 10). Execute actions based on a 
                                  random interval between start and stop seconds. 
                                  Note: Overwrites the seconds argument.

-d, --disabled                    Disables keep-presence at startup (adds the ~/.keep-presence-disabled
                                  file). This is useful if you are enabling/disabling this program's operation
                                  via another method.                                  
```
